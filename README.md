# ACB (AXIAL COMPRESSING BEAM): Open-Source Tool 

An open-source tool developed for beam axial compressions. 

Based on the concept of the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**, this code allows users to freely control relevant variables for beam calculations. The program analyzes the **axial compression** of a beam under **static loading conditions**.
